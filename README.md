## Notes

1. Only one question can be made per survey (the ADD QUESTION feature was not implemented for this prototype)
2. You can add as many answers per question as you like
3. Question and answers get stored on localhost until user starts another survey, then localhost storage will get cleared
4. Responsiveness was not implemented for this prototype

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
